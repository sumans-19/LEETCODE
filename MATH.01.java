// Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
// You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

CODE=>
  class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        // For special cases when x is 0 or 1, return x.
        if (x == 0 || x == 1)
            return x;

        // Initialize the search range for the square root.
        int start = 1;
        int end = x;
        int mid = -1;

        // Perform binary search to find the square root of x.
        while (start <= end) {
            // Calculate the middle point using "start + (end - start) / 2" to avoid integer overflow.
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            // If the square of the middle value is greater than x, move the "end" to the left (mid - 1).
            if ((long) mid * mid > (long) x)
                end = mid - 1;
            else if (mid * mid == x)
                // If the square of the middle value is equal to x, we found the square root.
                return mid;
            else
                // If the square of the middle value is less than x, move the "start" to the right (mid + 1).
                start = mid + 1;
        }

        // The loop ends when "start" becomes greater than "end", and "end" is the integer value of the square root.
        // However, since we might have been using integer division in the calculations,
        // we round down the value of "end" to the nearest integer to get the correct square root.
        return Math.round(end);

Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(logN). It's very efficient because 
Binary Search reduces the search range by half in each iteration, making the search faster.
Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1), which means the amount of extra memory used is constant, regardless of the input. 
We only use a few variables to store the search range and the middle value during the computation.




// Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

// answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
// answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
// answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
// answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

CODE => 
  import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                result.add("FizzBuzz");
            } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
                result.add("Fizz");
            } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
                result.add("Buzz");
            } else {
                result.add(Integer.toString(i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}


Time Complexity: ( O(n) ), as we iterate from 1 to ( n ).
Space Complexity: ( O(n) ), as we store the result in a list.
