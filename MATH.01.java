// Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
// You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

  class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        // For special cases when x is 0 or 1, return x.
        if (x == 0 || x == 1)

        int start = 1;
        int end = x;
        int mid = -1;

        // Perform binary search to find the square root of x.
        while (start <= end) {
            // Calculate the middle point using "start + (end - start) / 2" to avoid integer overflow.
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            // If the square of the middle value is greater than x, move the "end" to the left (mid - 1).
            if ((long) mid * mid > (long) x)
                end = mid - 1;
            else if (mid * mid == x)
                // If the square of the middle value is equal to x, we found the square root.
                return mid;
            else
                // If the square of the middle value is less than x, move the "start" to the right (mid + 1).
                start = mid + 1;
        }

        // The loop ends when "start" becomes greater than "end", and "end" is the integer value of the square root.
        // However, since we might have been using integer division in the calculations,
        // we round down the value of "end" to the nearest integer to get the correct square root.
        return Math.round(end);
    }
}



// Complexity
// Time complexity:
// The time complexity of this approach is O(logN). It's very efficient because 
// Binary Search reduces the search range by half in each iteration, making the search faster.
// Space complexity:
// The space complexity is O(1), which means the amount of extra memory used is constant, regardless of the input. 
// We only use a few variables to store the search range and the middle value during the computation.
