A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

  code => 
  class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                // If the middle element is greater than the next, the peak is on the left
                right = mid;
            } else {
                // If the middle element is less than the next, the peak is on the right
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left; // `left` will point to a peak element
    }
}
