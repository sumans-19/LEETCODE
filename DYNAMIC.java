// You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
// Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

// This solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to climb n stairs using dynamic programming principles.



// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

// Complexity:
// Time Complexity:

// O(amount√ócoins.length), since we iterate over all amounts and all coins.
// Space Complexity:

// O(amount), as we use a single array of size amount + 1.



The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 


CODE =?
  class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        if(n<=1)return n;
        int i = fib(n-1);
        int j = fib(n-2);
        return i + j;
    }
}


// or 

class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        int a = 0, b = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a + b;
            a = temp;
        }
